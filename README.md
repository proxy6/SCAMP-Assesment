# FIBONACCI SEQUENCE APP
An app that outputs the fibonacci sequence of any number inputed
## How it Works
- Fibonacci sequence is a famous group of numbers beginning with 0 and 1 in which each number is the sum of the two     before it. It begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and continues infinitely.
- A user is required to input the number he wants to get a fibonacci sequence of
- the fibonacci sequence of the number inputted by the user appears below
- A clear Input button clears both the user input and the displayed result
